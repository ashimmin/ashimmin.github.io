    I care deeply about crafting forward-thinking design solutions without the intrusive or
    prescriptive qualities that demand your attention elsewhere. I am influenced by aspects of play, craftsmanship,
    and creating intrinsic motivation when crafting experiences for others, and actively try to embody those traits in myself.
<br><br>
  I received my BFA for <a href=http://www.ixd.cca.edu/#bfaintro>Interaction Design in 2018 at California College of the Arts</a> in San Francisco. During my time at CCA, I
  crafted many unique experiences for others, ranging from the the elegant and poetic speculative mobility futures with <a href=http://greenfieldlabs.com/>Ford Motors</a>, to the practicality of the future of student loan payments with <a href=http://usa.visa.com/>Visa</a>.
  In the summer of 2017 I interned as an Experience Designer at the consumer product firm <a href=http://fuseproject.com/>fuseproject</a>, where I worked on smart home fitness interfaces, and VR product demo galleries. </p> <br><p>In the
    summer of 2018 I collaborated on a design sprint with <a href=http://ideocolab.com/>IDEO CoLab</a> as well as designed for the consumer lending company <a href=http://blend.com/>Blend </a> as their first product design intern. Here, I redesigned the
    new hire onboarding experience, BlendU, with the help of the Organization Effectiveness team. In the summer of 2019 I joined <a href="http://reduct.video">Reduct.Video</a> as an "all-hats" designer, helping to define a preliminary design system for their product, as well as pitch decks and branding for their
    prospective funding rounds. Currently, I work for <a href=http://cisco.com/>Cisco's Collaboration Design Team</a>, working on telecommunication products at the enterprise and system infrastructure level.

  In my free time I apprentice at a clay studio, creating functional ceramic ware for friends who didn't ask for them. I'm a professional .jpg and .mp3 consumer, and my hobbies involve taking up new hobbies.

  <!-- I design to help people learn and understand effortlessly. By emphasizing aspects of exploration and storytelling to guide the experience, I work to create engaging and intuitive design solutions that won't demand your attention away from you.
  I'm a designer who is invigorated by imbuing complex design problems with a sense of delight. My focus revolves around using the power of story to create dynamic experiencesâ€”visual, auditory, temporal, or otherwise.

  Looking to work cross-functionally with humanx pushing the needle on forward-thinking design.

  Music, cinema, and literature are important to me. I look to these media to inform my work and research as much as possible.
