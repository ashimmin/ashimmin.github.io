As a visual designer on the Collaboration Design team, I worked with the interaction designer to help turn their wireframes into pixel perfect mockups referencing Ciscoâ€™s design system, [Momentum](https://momentum.design/). Projects included designs for Cisco's Webex Cloud-Connected Unified Communications platform, and UI for Cisco's next generation desk phone.
