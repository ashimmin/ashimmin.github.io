<br>
<br>
As a visual designer on the Collaboration Design team, I worked with the interaction designer to help turn their wireframes into pixel perfect mockups referencing Cisco's design system, [Momentum](https://momentum.design/). Projects included designs for telecom system infrastructure, and admin tools for server maintenance.

MyDesk is a desktop device for businesses with hot-desking work environments; employees can reserve any desk through MyDesk and use it to assist them in their daily tasks such as scheduling or meetings. My responsibilities were to work along side the other visual designers to make sure MyDesk had visual continuity with the rest of Cisco's conferencing suite which included meeting room devices such as the Touch10 and Phoenix room system.
