During my time at fuseproject, I was able to work on the first interactions for the [FORME Life](https://formelife.com/) smart home fitness workout machine, as well as the entire workout experienceâ€” from the technology embedded in the machine, all the way to the digital interfaces and its surrounding touchpoints.

Additionally, I spent some time learning how to 3D model and worked on a VR Demo Gallery concept for fuseproject and their clients. Fuseproject often had to share their ideas on the road or on-site. Carrying various different physical prototypes quickly became cumbersome. This project offered to create a VR environment to show clients recent products using a Google Daydream. Prototypes were made in Blender and Unity.
