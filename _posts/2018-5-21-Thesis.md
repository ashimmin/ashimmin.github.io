excerpt: Interfaces For Learning was a year long research project investigating the ways we learn online. There is an abundance of online resources for learning these days, but they sometime blur the line between education and entertainment. In this study, I surveyed existing literature on personal knowledge bases, information storage, and learning theory; interviewed potential users and experts on the subject; created numerous prototypes, both physical and digital; and collaborated directly with Alcamy.org, an online learning platform founded in 2016, to improve their system based on my research insights and experiments.

My work on interfaces for learning aims to empower people to create meaningful relationships with their knowledge to support a mind of deep interest and curiosity, so that even the biggest problems can be deconstructed and understood. The final prototypes I created are a glimpse at the possibility of what screen-based learning could be, but the future for learning goes beyond the screen to enhance how one learns.
